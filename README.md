# RouteIQ — AI Daily Briefing for Field Sales Reps

> *"Walk in knowing everything. Never wing a sales call again."*

---

## 🎯 The Problem

Field sales reps (territory managers, med-device reps, pharma reps, equipment distributors) drive hundreds of miles a week, bounce between 6–10 accounts a day, and most of them prep for calls by glancing at their phone in the parking lot.

Current tools suck for solo reps:
- SPOTIO / Badger Maps: $100–$150/mo, bloated, team-focused
- CRMs: They log data, they don't brief you
- Google Maps: Zero intelligence, just directions

**The gap:** A focused, affordable AI tool that tells you *who you're seeing today, what to say, and the fastest path between them.*

---

## 💡 The Solution

RouteIQ is a mobile-first web app that:

1. **Imports your accounts** (CSV, Google Sheets, or manual)
2. **Plans your day** — optimizes visit order by geography (TSP algorithm)
3. **Briefs you before each stop** — AI-generated 3-sentence "walk-in card" per account: last interaction, what they care about, a conversation opener
4. **Logs calls in 10 seconds** — voice-to-text note after each visit
5. **Sends you a daily recap** — email summary of what happened + tomorrow's top priorities

Everything runs automatically. No manual data entry beyond the initial account import.

## 💰 Business Model

### Pricing
| Plan | Price | Who |
|------|-------|-----|
| **Solo** | $29/mo | Individual rep |
| **Team** | $79/mo | Up to 5 reps |
| **Agency** | $199/mo | 6–20 reps + manager dashboard |

Annual discount: 20% off (captures cash upfront, reduces churn)

### Unit Economics (Conservative)
- CAC: ~$40 (Twitter/LinkedIn content + Google Ads on "territory manager app")
- LTV at $29/mo, 18-month avg retention: **$522**
- LTV:CAC ratio: **13:1** — exceptional
- Gross margin: ~85% (OpenAI API costs ~$0.50–2/user/mo)

### Revenue Projections
| Milestone | MRR | Timeline |
|-----------|-----|----------|
| 10 customers | $290 | Week 2 |
| 50 customers | $1,450 | Month 2 |
| 200 customers | $5,800 | Month 6 |
| 500 customers | $14,500 | Month 12 |

**Year 1 target: $10K MRR = $120K ARR** — realistic with focused LinkedIn/Reddit outreach to field sales communities.

## 🎯 Target Customer

**Primary:** Territory managers in:

- B2B equipment (HVAC, safety, industrial)
